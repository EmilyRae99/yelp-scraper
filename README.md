# Scraping Yelp

Have you ever wondered what the funniest Yelp review ever written was? Or the coolest? Well unfortunately, the Yelp API currently has no way of finding this out. I decided I find out myself.

## Requirements

Python 2.7 is required. Install dependencies with:

    pip install -r requirements.tt

## Step 1: scrape Yelp.com reviews from every restaurant.
